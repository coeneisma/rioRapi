\title{Visualize relationships between RIO datasets}
\usage{
rio_visualize_structure(
  datasets = NULL,
  relations = NULL,
  min_confidence = "medium",
  interactive = TRUE,
  highlight_datasets = NULL,
  find_paths = TRUE,
  max_path_length = 3,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{datasets}{Optional character vector of dataset names to visualize.
If NULL, all datasets in the structure will be visualized.}

\item{relations}{Optional relation definitions. If NULL, relations are loaded from the YAML file.}

\item{min_confidence}{Minimum confidence level for relationships.
Can be "high" or "medium". Default is "medium".}

\item{interactive}{Logical indicating whether to create an interactive visualization
(requires visNetwork package). Default is TRUE.}

\item{highlight_datasets}{Character vector of dataset names to highlight in the visualization.}

\item{find_paths}{Logical indicating whether to find connection paths between datasets
that are not directly connected. Default is TRUE.}

\item{max_path_length}{Maximum length of connection paths to consider when find_paths is TRUE.
Default is 3.}

\item{...}{Optional named tibbles to visualize connections between (alternative method).}
}
\value{
A visualization object showing the relationships between datasets.
}
\description{
This function creates a visualization of the relationships between RIO datasets
based on the YAML-defined structure. It can show connections between specific datasets,
including indirect connections through intermediary datasets.
