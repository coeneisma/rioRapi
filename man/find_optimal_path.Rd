)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset_names}{Character vector with names of datasets to connect}

\item{relations}{List of relation definitions}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether to display progress messages}

\item{start_with_first}{Logical indicating whether to force starting with the first dataset.
Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A list with path information, including:
\itemize{
\item path: The sequence of datasets to visit
\item connections: Details about each connection in the path
}
}
\description{
