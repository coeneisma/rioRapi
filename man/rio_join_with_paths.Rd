rather than actual datasets. Default is FALSE.}

\item{reference_date}{Optional date to filter valid records. Default is NULL (no filtering).}

\item{nested}{Logical indicating whether to return a nested tibble. Default is FALSE.}

\item{find_paths}{Logical indicating whether to find indirect paths between tables.
Default is TRUE.}

\item{max_path_length}{Maximum length of connection paths to consider when find_paths is TRUE.
Default is 3.}
